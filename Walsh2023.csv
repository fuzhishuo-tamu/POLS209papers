The NPA makes regular use of minors in its operations In March a 12-year old NPA rebel was captured by the AFP in Bontoc, Southern Leyte, during a raid in which the boy's parents (both NPA leaders) and 13-year-old sister were killed. The boy told authorities he had become an NPA fighter at age 9 and had since become a recruiter himself. He said that there were 20 minors – 15 boys and 5 girls – in his unit. The boy, who stated that he had taken part in at least 12 ambushes, demonstrated adult proficiency as a soldier. In March a 12-year old boy escaped from the NPA and surrendered to the AFP in Kiamba, Sarangani. The boy reportedly told authorities that while in first grade, an NPA recruiter threatened to kill him if he did not join. The NPA's use of children as armed combatants and noncombatants continued. According to UNICEF and AFP estimates, 3 percent of the more than 10,000 members of the NPA are boys and girls under the age of 18. However, from 20 to 25 percent of NPA new recruits reportedly are children. The NPA admits that members from 15 to 18 years of age are assigned to self-defense and noncombat duties and that in the event of enemy aggression or encroachment, weapons would be distributed to the oldest children first.

In attacks by Serbian forces on towns along the Drina river in April and May, hundreds and perhaps thousands of Muslim civilians were killed.  However, the atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims pale in comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Muslims, ostensibly in defense of the interests of Serbs in Bosnia.","Limitations of space and the standardized format used in tnis report make it diilicult to detail the true scope and horror of the atrocities committed by these Serbian forces. Much of the earliest violence (predating recognition) was caused by paramilitary units from Serbia and Montenegro which carried out acts of terror and intimidation against non-Serbs. The war did not break out spontaneously but was consciously stimulated from the outside in the absence of any significant threat to the safety of the Serbian Dopulation. The greatest atrocity — ^the systematic shelling and starva- tion by siege of large cities — was carried out by Serbian forces, which alone had both the means and the Mrill to carry out such crimes against humanity. Civilians were the primary targets of military action, making a mockery of the Geneva Conven- tions. ccompanjring abuses of individuals and groups of non-Serbs took almost every conceivable form of torture, humiliation, amd killing.  In Serb-run camps, many prisoners were subjected to the most brutal forms of torture and murder their captors could devise.Systematic rape has been used, largely against the Muslim population, by the Bosnian Serbs as part of their ethnic cleansing campaign.At Keraterm, there were reports of murders of prisoners, with inmates forced to carry their bodies out and stack them on trucks to be transported elsewhere. At the Trnopoje camp, Serbian soldiers wandered through nightly, brutally beatings the male prisoners and randomly raping female prisoners.In Serbian camps near Foca,Muslim women were repeatedly raped, according to refugee accounts.","Limitations of space and the standardized format used in tnis report make it diilicult to detail the true scope and horror of the atrocities committed by these Serbian forces.

On June 3, al-Shabaab entered the home of a family in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle, and confiscated television and satellite equipment it suspected of being used to watch the TFG-owned Somali National Television channel. In July al-Shabaab issued a formal edict forbidding Jowhar residents to watch Somali television channels, and there were numerous reports of al-Shabaab entering people’s homes to enforce the ban. On August 10, al-Shabaab summoned all owners of satellite dishes and gave them three days to reposition their satellite to an eastward orientation, from which they could not receive Somali television channels, or have their dishes confiscated. On several occasions al-Shabaab forcibly evicted people from their homes in order to house al-Shabaab leaders. For example, on May 31, al-Shabaab militia forcibly evicted homeowners in the Howlwadag neighborhood of Jowhar, including a prominent traditional elder. Al-Shabaab forces withdrew from most of Mogadishu on August 6, abandoning homes and land it had previously confiscated from Mogadishu residents or which had been evacuated during clashes between Ethiopian forces and extremists in 2007. People slowly began returning to their homes afterwards, causing some disputes over land ownership. There was no mechanism to address such disputes.","Al-Shabaab committed human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings; disappearances; cruel and unusual punishment; rape; restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of movement; restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian assistance; and use of child soldiers.

Widespread attacks on civilians, including ethnically based killings and sexual assaults, were reported.","","","","Clashes between SPLA and SPLA-IO forces broke out in Juba on July 8. The violence resulted in the deaths of hundreds, including two UN peacekeepers, and temporarily displaced as many as 42,000 persons. During the clashes, armed actors and civilians looted the primary WFP warehouse in the city. Prior to the incident, the warehouse contained an estimated 4,500 metric tons of emergency food and nutrition commodities, as well as fuel, generators, office equipment, vehicles, and other items. The WFP estimated the looted nutrition supplies would have been sufficient to provide one-month rations to 220,000 persons. The looting resulted in a financial loss to WFP of approximately $28 million, including $8 million in nutrition commodities","","The August 2015 peace agreement mandated specialized international agencies work with all warring parties to demobilize and reintegrate child soldiers from the SPLA, the SPLA-IO, the Nuer White Army, and other groups, usually those involved in community defense. Between January and June 2015, UNICEF’s program in the Greater Pibor (Jonglei State) Administrative Authority demobilized and reintegrated 1,755 child soldiers, most of whom were released by chief administrator David Yau Yau’s Cobra Faction. Another 145 children were released in October. UNICEF warned renewed fighting undermined the progress it had made in demobilizing and reintegrating child soldiers, and acknowledged some of the children had been re-recruited.","","Early July fighting in Juba between the SPLA and SPLA-IO resulted in more than 300 deaths.

During approximately five days of fighting in the capital, thousands of persons were displaced, with an estimated 12,000 seeking refuge at UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites in the capital. According to the UN Panel of Experts on South Sudan, there was an apparent ethnic dimension to the fighting, and, “the indiscriminate use of weapons by both the SPLA and the SPLA-IO displayed a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians and the inviolability of UN premises.” Having suffered heavy losses, Machar and hundreds of his fighters fled the capital and, eventually, the country.
